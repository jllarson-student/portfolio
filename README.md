# Design Portfolio
This website project presents my design portfolio. 

## Project Purpose
Create a responsive website for my design portfolio using CSS Grid. I began this project as an assignment for a class at Wake Technical Community College. 

## Tools Used
Some of the tools I used include Microsoft Visual Studio Code, GIMP, Microsoft Paint 3D, [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), and [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/). 

## Issues
1. The initial commit only includes the site's home page. 
2. Social media links open the home page of each site rather than my personal page. I am not active on social media, so I will not be linking to personal accounts at this point. 
3. Image links on the home page do not show a complete view of each project. More thorough views will be on the detail pages for each project.
